## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

First tagged release. Everything built to date is collected here.

### Added

- **Durable ticket core.** An append-only, hash-chained event log with an on-disk
  store layout: each event carries its predecessor's hash, so any edit breaks the
  chain. `draiver audit` verifies the chain and exits nonzero if tampered.
- **CLI protocol verbs.** The agent/human protocol as commands — `new`, `log`,
  `escalate`, `resolve`, `review`, `done` for writes, and `brief`, `inbox`,
  `audit`, `status` to replay context and project state.
- **Per-attempt schema.** A ticket holds one or more independent *attempts*, each
  owning its own log, hash chain, and control state, so different tools or models
  can work the same `spec.md` and be compared and audited separately.
- **Read-only HTMX web board** (`draiver webui`) over a data folder: the
  four-column control-state board plus a per-ticket attempt detail view with
  markdown-rendered log bodies.
- **Onboarding skill for agents**, packaged as a Claude Code plugin marketplace
  under `./.claude` with a supported install path (`/plugin marketplace add` +
  `/plugin install`) (task-003).
- **Playwright end-to-end tests** covering the read-only web UI.
- **Markdown log bodies.** The web UI renders each log event body as sanitized
  markdown (script and unsafe links stripped); bodies are still stored as raw
  text, so the hash chain and `audit` are unaffected (task-004).
- **Branded favicon with a live badge.** The board serves a eucalypt-green "D"
  favicon that gains a rust-red badge whenever any attempt is Stuck (task-005).
- **Breadcrumb on the attempt detail page** — a `board › attempts › <attempt>`
  trail, so both the board and the attempt list are one click away (task-007).
- **Live attempt detail page.** The log timeline and status badge auto-refresh
  via htmx polling and stop polling once the attempt is terminal (the live
  fragment answers `286` to self-cancel); the whole-board poll, by contrast,
  never quiesces, since a new ticket or attempt can appear at any moment
  (task-008, task-009).
- **Log-ordering toggle** on the attempt detail page, switching between
  newest-first and oldest-first (task-002).
- **Deep links to a log entry.** Every event has a stable, shareable URL
  (`/ticket/{id}/{attempt}#event-{seq}`) with a copyable permalink that scrolls
  to and highlights the entry; the highlight survives the live log poll and the
  order toggle, and Stuck/Review cards link straight to the open escalation or
  review claim (task-011).
- **`draiver title`** command to set or update a ticket's `spec.md` title as
  metadata, outside the hash-chained log.
- **Mandatory ticket titles.** `draiver new` refuses a blank/whitespace title,
  and a `--spec` import can carry its title via `title:` frontmatter (task-012).

### Changed

- **Board columns reordered and relabeled** to `Running | Stuck | Review | Done`;
  the column formerly named "Needs me" is now "Stuck" (task-001).
- **Attempt log defaults to newest-first** in the detail view, reversing the
  previous oldest-first default (task-002).
- **Onboarding skill restructured** from a loose `skills/` folder into the
  `./.claude` plugin marketplace, giving one canonical, installable location
  (task-003).
- **Favicon badge decoupled from the DOM.** The Stuck badge now flips off an htmx
  `HX-Trigger` event carrying the board state, instead of scraping a
  `data-testid` count out of the page (task-010).

### Fixed

- **Onboarding skill corrected** to match the intended protocol: agents escalate
  to ask and then stop, the human records the resolution, and there is no
  mid-session re-brief. Documented the "agents are cattle" respawn model.
